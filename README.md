# TNM048-Information-Visualization
In this project me and my two project partners created a geovisualization of a game map. The dataset we have chosen to visualize is a dataset from the game Playerunknownâ€™s Battlegrounds, also known as PUBG. We visualize a players death by plotting the normalized coordinates on the map, every death is represented by a circle.
